                <p>Description: </p>
                <p>Miyamit Falls is one of the adventure-filled destinations in the province of Pampanga. Located in the belly of the Cabusilan Mountain Range, others would prove the trail could be daunting, thanks to hours and hours of trekking. But the awesome reward lies at the end of the waterfall trail, twin cascades dropping from sheer heights onto its catchbasin of seemingly ice cold water that would soothe those tired muscles. Less than two hours from the busy streets of nearby cities, the jump-off point features a community dominated by our dear Aeta brethren who would trade smiles as you go along.</p>
                <p>The local climate is cooler since of its altitude and scenery goes from flatlands to rolling terrain. Domesticated pigs roam freely the streets like our pet dogs or cats do. At some point from the trail, you can get a glimpse of the expansive plains which is actually Clark Freeport and cities of Angeles and Mabalacat. The lone summit, Mt. Arayat, an amazing backdrop with its feet covered with fog during dawn. Though this does not happen most of the time.</p>
