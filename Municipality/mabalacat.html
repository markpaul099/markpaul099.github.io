                <p>Attraction: Air Force City Park</p>
                <p>Description: </p>
                <p>Air Force City Park is a recreational complex that features real helicopters, fighter jets, and aviation equipment used by the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the United States. It is located within the Clark Freeport Zone in Pampanga, 96 kilometers north of Manila.</p>
                <p>The park is the perfect place to marvel at aircraft that served the country as a visit here will allow you to see a UH-1H Iroquois or a HUEY, a Vought F8 Crusader, an F5a Jet (which is also popularly called the Freedom Fighter), a T-28 Trojan, and a T-33 or a Thunder Bird, which was the country's first aircraft, ushering the Philippine Air Force into the jet age.</p>
                <p>Aside from a history tour, the park also offers shaded areas for visitors to have picnics or naps. Its wide space with a play area is also perfect for kids to run around and have fun.</p>
                <p>Entrance to the Air Force City Park is free, but you must secure a health clearance from the Air Force City Hospital. Note that you need to pay a minimal fee should you need to use the toilets here.</p>
                <p>Since the Air Force City Park is an outdoor venue, it's best to visit it during the dry but cool months, which are usually from November to February.</p>
