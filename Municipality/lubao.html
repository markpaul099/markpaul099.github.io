                <p>Description: </p>
                <p>The Lubao Bamboo Hub is an eco-tourism destination located by the riverbank of Sta. Catalina in Lubao, Pampanga. The bamboo hub serves as both a protective shield against threats of soil erosion and a tourist destination. It has been open to visitors since 2017. Aside from serving as a disaster response, the bamboo was also eyed to be used as an alternative to commercial lumber.</p>
                <p>The project's objective was to create a sustainable livelihood program for farmers and the community's families by turning bamboo into different products. To further promote the wonders and uses of bamboo, the six-hectare property along the riverbank was developed into an eco-tourism destination. Managed by the Lubao Municipal Government, the Lubao Bamboo Hub and Eco-Park attracts around 600 visitors every weekend.</p>
                <p>With its bending bamboo culms forming a canopy, resembling an enchanting forest overhead, the Lubao Bamboo Hub is a relaxing tourist destination for people who want to relax and take a stroll. Visitors can rent a bike to roam around the park. There's also a fish spa, good for the removal of dead skin and calluses. Tourists can also rent a kayak or boat where they can enjoy a relaxing ride along Gumain river.</p>
