                <p>Description: </p>
                <p>Unlike the Angkor Wat, which has served as a religious complex since time immemorial, Bale Batu was built for personal use. That said, the construction process took years; and the end result, a labour of love.</p>
                <p>Jesus Padilla, also known as Apung Susing, started building this little Cambodian temple in Pampanga in the ’70s. According to travellers, Apung Susing started constructing this house by hand, employing pulverised mountain rocks and cement. He chose these materials to keep their house fireproof.</p>
                <p>Other than a shelter, Bale Batu was its homeowner’s expression of art. One wouldn’t miss Apung Susing’s creative touches to their home. And now that Bale Batu even has plants flourishing around — and even within — it, the home has become a tourist attraction itself.</p>
                <p>With the growing community of bikers, Bale Batu has since become popular among cyclists now more than ever. If you’re interested in visiting the destination on your wheels, simply pin “Gintung Pakpak Ecopark.”</p>
