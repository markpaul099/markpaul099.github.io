                <p>Attraction: Lakeshore</p>
                <p>Description: </p>
                <p>THE LAKESHORE is a first-class residential, commercial and recreational project of Central Country Estate, Inc.  Lakeshore is located at Kilometer 71 of the North Luzon expressway, Mexico, Pampanga – a 40 – minute drive from Balintawak tollgate, 12 minutes from Diosdado Macapagal International Airport, and just 5 minutes from SM and Robinsons Malls Pampanga.</p>
                <p>The Lakeshore is a first master-planned community in the country to offer residents a world of secluded lakeside luxury, 250 hectares of prime land crowned with a magnificent 12 hectare man-made lake. Residents need not go far to enjoy adventure-filled activities like fishing, sailing and kayaking.</p>
                <p>This lake is now thriving with aquatic life like milk fish, ’tilapia’, mangrove jack, carps and large-mouth bass and sea bass. As such, the Lakeshore boasts itself of fast becoming the consummate getaway for both local and foreign tourists. Families may frolic in lakeside parks and playgrounds linked by scenic boardwalks while being surrounded with an atmosphere of a Mediterranean village with palm-lined streets, lakeside restaurants and promenade with street cafes and exclusive shopping arcade, a waterfront resort hotel, a business park, a school and a church. These activities are afforded only by lakeside residential living.</p>
